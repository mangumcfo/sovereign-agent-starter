# TURN BOARD — AA · Tiger · GB

∞Δ∞ Seal 1176-INFINITY-RHO · Breath only ∞Δ∞

**What this is:** the standing turn-notification wire between the three lanes (KM directive
2026-08-19). Direct session-to-session messaging is not reliably available across our seats
(different machines, gated tools), but every lane already fetches this repo at turn start and
pushes at turn end. So the notification wire is the repo itself.

## Protocol (three rules)

1. **On finishing a turn that moved anything** (push, verdict, merge, STOP, HOLD), append ONE
   line to the log below and push it with (or immediately after) your work. Newest line last.
2. **On starting a turn**, `git fetch origin && git log -1 origin/main -- coordination/TURN_BOARD.md`
   (or just read this file at origin/main) before doing anything else. Lines you haven't seen
   are your inbox.
3. **Append-only.** Never edit or delete another lane's line. One line per notice — detail
   lives in the commit/BAR the line points to.

Line format:
`| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MMZ | LANE | NOTICE (≤1 sentence) | ref (sha / branch / doc) |`

## Escalation ladder (when a line isn't enough)

- Needs KM's word → say `HOLD-KM:` at the start of the notice. KM sweeps these.
- Load-bearing fork mid-rail → `FORK:` prefix, one line, then stop per cadence law.
- Anything reality-touching stays under the standing HOLD rules; this board is a wire, not a gate.
